# PCA in R

## Overview

This repository contains R code for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a dataset. PCA is a technique used for dimensionality reduction, particularly useful for exploring patterns and reducing the number of features in high-dimensional datasets.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to use the PCA code:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Install R and Required Libraries:**
Ensure that R is installed on your system. Install the necessary R library by running:

3. **Run the PCA Script:**
Replace `"your_dataset.csv"` with the actual file path or URL of your dataset. Execute the R script:

## Code Explanation

The `pca_script.R` file contains detailed comments explaining each step of the PCA process. Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code for your specific needs.

## Additional Notes

- Adjustments may be required based on your dataset's structure.
- Save and use the PCA results for further analysis or visualization.
